## Project Overview
MozaGlow Botanicals started in Mozambique with a small kitchen, a handful of natural ingredients, and a big passion for clean beauty. It began as a personal journey to create skincare free from harsh chemicals, using traditional local plants like baobab, moringa, and coconut oil. Slowly, word spread, and MozaGlow grew from homemade batches to a trusted skincare brand.

Now, we want to bring our natural glow to a wider audience by creating a welcoming online space where customers can learn, shop, and connect with our brand.
## Vision

To become the leading  South African natural skincare brand that celebrates Mozambican ingredients and empowers people to embrace their natural glow.

## REASON FOR WEBSITE PROPOSAL CHOSEN

As an international student from Mozambique, this project means a lot to me. Through the MozaGlow Botanicals website, I want to share the natural beauty of my country ,the ingredients we use, the stories they carry, and the care rooted in our traditions. It’s also a way to proudly represent Mozambique, blending heritage and innovation into a digital experience that feels warm, authentic, and welcoming.

## Part 1 Details
Building the basis of a project using HTML is the task for Part 1, which entails planning through research, target audience definition, goal formulation, and the creation of a thorough project plan.  Project planning is essential because it makes it possible to create a well-structured, thoroughly researched project, which guarantees a more seamless workflow.

## Part 2 Details
In Part 2, I took the basic HTML pages and gave them style and personality using CSS. I linked one stylesheet to all the pages so everything looks consistent. I added colours, fonts, and layouts that match the natural theme of MozaGlow Botanicals. I also made the site responsive with media queries, so it works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile. This part really brought the website to life and made it feel modern and user-friendly.
